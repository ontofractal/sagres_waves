Sagres is a beautiful place in Portugal, where steep cliffs are shaped and eroded by waves. As a fan of puns, I find Sagres to be a fitting name for vesting contracts for WAVES blockchain.

# Why?

Vesting is a tool that can be used to align incentives of project co-founders, employees, consultants and investors.


# Features

Sagres includes a vesting smart contract template that accepts a set of parameters and generates a RIDE smart contract that is designed to be attached to individual accounts of token holders.

| originalAssetAmount | A starting amount of tokens for the given account |
